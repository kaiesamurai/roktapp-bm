**ROCTapp: Redefining Social Networking on Scroll**

Welcome to ROCTapp, a decentralized social network built on Scroll. We're dedicated to fostering meaningful interactions and experiences by focusing on specific actions within social networks.

### What's New on ROCTapp?

ROCTapp prioritizes two key aspects: meaningful posts and module checks.

#### Meaningful Posts
We offer three types of posts:
1. **Vote**: Users can create vote posts, automatically generating a contract with the poster as the owner.
2. **Fundings**: Creating a Funding post results in the automatic creation of a contract, with the poster as the owner. Only the owner can withdraw funds.
3. **Calls for Investment**: Traders can share investment tokens, with the current price compared to the price at the time of writing. This enables users to evaluate the accuracy of the writer's comments.

#### Module Checks
Module checks are pieces of code contributed and created by the community in the form of NFTs. Users who own the NFTs can utilize the code to verify information posted. For instance, if there's a call to invest in token A, users can use community-contributed modules to verify if the poster actually owns the token, ensuring authenticity.

### Chainlink DataFeed Integration

ROCTapp leverages Chainlink DataFeed to retrieve token prices and compare them between the time of the article's writing and the present. This fosters trust between influencers and users, enhancing transparency and reliability.

### How It's Built

ROCTapp is built using Hardhat and Next.js. We utilize web3.storage to store post information and module metadata. Post content identifiers (CIDs) are saved in smart contracts for easy reference and retrieval.

### How to Use Modules

Using modules on ROCTapp is straightforward. Users can reference code snippets from Metamask documentation and interact with the smart contracts seamlessly.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind ROCTapp comes from the desire to revolutionize social networking by prioritizing meaningful interactions and ensuring authenticity and transparency in shared content. Traditional social networks often lack mechanisms to verify the accuracy of posted information, leading to trust issues and misinformation. ROCTapp aims to address these challenges by integrating features such as module checks and leveraging blockchain technology to foster a community-driven approach to social networking.

## What it does

ROCTapp facilitates meaningful interactions through its innovative features:
- **Meaningful Posts**: Users can create various types of posts, including votes, fundings, and calls for investment, each serving specific purposes to enhance engagement and transparency.
- **Module Checks**: Community-contributed modules enable users to verify the authenticity of posted content, fostering trust and reliability within the network.
- **Chainlink DataFeed Integration**: Utilizing Chainlink DataFeed, ROCTapp ensures accurate and up-to-date information, particularly in investment-related posts, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness.

## How we built it

ROCTapp was built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies and development tools:
- **Hardhat and Next.js**: Leveraging Hardhat for smart contract development and Next.js for frontend development, ensuring scalability and performance.
- **web3.storage**: Utilizing web3.storage to store post information and module metadata securely on the decentralized web.
- **Chainlink Integration**: Integrating Chainlink DataFeed to retrieve token prices and enable accurate comparisons between the time of writing and the present.

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges, including:
- **Technical complexities**: Integrating blockchain technology and decentralized features posed technical challenges that required innovative solutions.
- **Smart contract deployment**: Ensuring smooth deployment of smart contracts and verifying their functionality on the blockchain required careful attention to detail.
- **User experience**: Balancing functionality with usability to create an intuitive and engaging user experience presented its own set of challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, we're proud to have achieved several milestones with ROCTapp:
- Successfully implementing meaningful post types and module checks to enhance transparency and authenticity.
- Integrating Chainlink DataFeed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date information, particularly in investment-related posts.
- Building a vibrant community of users committed to meaningful interactions and reliable information sharing.
